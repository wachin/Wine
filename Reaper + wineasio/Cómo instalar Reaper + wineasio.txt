CÃ³mo instalar Reaper en MX Linux 



Registering WineASIO libraries

If you have run KXStudio Welcome Setup previously then you should already have the wineasio.dll library registered. Otherwise, for example if you have messed up or deleted your Wine configuration, you should run:

regsvr32 wineasio.dll

If you're running a 64-bit OS and you want to run 64-bit Windows software under wine, run the following too:

wine64 regsvr32 wineasio.dll

You should only need to issue these commands once, if at all, but there is no harm in re-running them.
