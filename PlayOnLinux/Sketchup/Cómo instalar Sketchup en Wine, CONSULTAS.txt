$ export WINEARCH=win64
$ winetricks vcrun2015 corefonts
$ winetricks win7
- Download .NET Framework 4.5.2 (offline version) and install it with the command:
$ wine start /unix NDP452-KB2901907-x86-x64-AllOS-ENU.exe
- Then run the actual SketchUp installer:
$ wine SketchUpMake-it-x64.exe (or the Pro version, either works)
- Follow the installation steps
- Run SketchUp (you can run it just fine from the .desktop created by WINE itself)

@Oliver: 
It seems that you miss the64-bit version of mfc140u.dll in the wine windows/system32 folder.
Try to download it from a reliable URL and simply copy it over.

We have to beware that the 32bits mfc140u.dll has to be put in the syswow64 directory, and the 64bits in the 32bits one. 
I did the mistake and it didn't work, it worked fine when I inverse.

Install Google SketchUp Make 2014 in Ubuntu 14.04 | UbuntuHandbook
http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/06/install-google-sketchup-ubuntu1404/

Once wine is installed, config it by running:

winecfg

In “Wine Configuration” window, you may:

Change Windows Version to Windows 7 in the bottom of the Applications tab.
Under Libraries tab, select ‘Riched20’ library from the drop-down list and add it
wine-configuration

1. On my 64 bit Ubuntu 14.04, SketchUp 2014 hangs after choosing a template. This has been reported as a bug and seemed to be fixed in Wine 1.7.19. However, I still get this error.

The workaround is disable Ruby API by launching SketchUp via:

wine "C:\Program Files (x86)\SketchUp\SketchUp 2014\SketchUp.exe" "/DisableRubyAPI"
Or, in the Properties window of the desktop shortcut, add /DisableRubyAPI to the end of command area:

disablerubyapi

2. If sketch up doesn’t work because of a problem with a graphics card

1. Run below command to bring up Registry Editor:

wine regedit
2. Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER -> Software -> Google -> SketchUp version -> GLConfig -> Display

3. Change the value of HW_OK to 1 (so that it shows up as 0×00000001 (1)

Launch SketchUp Make 2016

Here is how I make it work (32bit ONLY): 
This will work: Dialog of extensions, Dynamic components, 2D grafics export .... just about everything will work. 
Not working: Direct import from 3D Warehouse and Extension Warehouse, but download from a browser and install/import manually will work. 

Fedora 23 with wine 1.9.5 Stagging (Fedora installs wine stagging by default, don't know if its needed). 
You must have winetricks installed. 


- Make a new and clean 32 bit prefix. 

export WINEPREFIX=~/.sketchup 
export WINEARCH=win32 
wineboot 


- Install ie8 AND ie7 

winetricks ie8 
winetricks ie7 


- open winetricks in terminal: 

winetricks 

Make sure these DLL/components are installed: 
comctl32ocx 
gdiplus 
gdiplus_winxp 
msls31 
msxml3 
pngfilt 
wininet 
wsh56vb 
xmllite 



- Open Wine Configuration in terminal: 

winecfg 
Change OS to Windows 7 (from the default XP) 



- Install Sketchup 2016 32bit (assuming you have the Sketchup installer in Home): 

wine "sup_2016_en_x32.exe" 



---- IMPORTANT NOTES 

Do everything from the same terminal session, to make sure all changes are made to the new .sketchup prefix. If you start winetricks or wine configuration from your distro's menu system. changes will be made to the default .wine prefix - NOT what you want. 

Trying to use Theme options in Wine Configuration will likely break Sketchup dialogs. 

Hope this works for you too.
