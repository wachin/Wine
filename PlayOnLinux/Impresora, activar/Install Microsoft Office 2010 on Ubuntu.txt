2. Printers

If you have a printer properly configured under Ubuntu, probably it'll be automatically available to MSOffice under wine.

If not, we can make it available. Basically, your printer must be installed using cups. No problem if the printer is installed using other softwares/drivers, but to get it available for wine, it must be installed under cups too.

If cups package is not installed, install it:

sudo apt-get install cups
Then, open http://localhost:631/ and add your printer.

After configure it, print a test page using the related printer in Printers from System Settings.

Now, make sure you have this file: /etc/printcap. If it's not present, create it this way:

ln -sf /var/run/cups/printcap /etc/printcap

Reboot wine: open PlayOnLinux, click Configure, select Office2010, click on Wine tab and click on Windows reboot button.
