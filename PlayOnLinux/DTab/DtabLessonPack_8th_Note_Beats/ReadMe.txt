 Intro:
 ======


  Since 8th note rhythms make up such a large proportion of what we play, I've laid
 out a series of 10 progressive lessons to help you really get started. Each lesson,
 contains 20 exercises all in DTAB and TAB format. So those with DTAB can hear how
 each lesson sounds. You can get DTAB from http://www.DTAB.UnderwareDesign.com 

 
  So these lessons will have a common theme, where the Hi-Hat and Bass Drum patterns
 remain the same, while the snare drum part is playing a variety of different
 patterns. You can somewhat think of this as a basic independence exercise, as we
 are trying to build the ability to independently play a variety of snare and bass
 drum patterns against the constant 8 note Hi-Hat pulse.


  The key to success is to make sure we're really familiar with ALL of the material
 from lesson one first. Once comfortable, then we can move onto the next lesson.  So
 It's important that we master the hand parts the best we can, as each lesson
 we'll be keeping the Hi-hat and previously learned snare patterns the same, but
 then changing the bass drum pattern slightly.


  While this might seem simple on the surface, via doing this, we're introducing
 various layers of coordination between our hands and bass drum foot. Which is
 why this can be a deceptively challenging study.


  These are only a brief look at the potential of this kind of study.  To take this
 further try  making up your own bass drum and snare patterns, change
 the drum voicing, add dynamics, go crazy !..

  Have fun!

 Practice Aims:
 ==============


 Aim #1: Try to get comfortable playing each rhythm through once, with & without the
         counting. If you can do this, try playing it twice, three, four times through
         or more without stopping. 

 Aim #2: Try for a range of tempos, Start out slowly, (around 80/90 bpm's) then medium
         (120bpm) and fast up to (150/160 bpm's or higher). The objective is make all
         the notes sound even. 


 Aim #3: Try playing each line of exercises without stopping, keeping it evenly spaced
         the entire time. Next, Try 2 lines, then 3 lines and ultimately the entire
         lesson from top to bottom. To take this another step further, you can try
         playing the exercises randomly, this will help your reading and visualization
         skills greatly.
