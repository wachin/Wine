 ======
 Intro:
 ======


  Quarter notes offer us a great place to start playing and learning drum rhythms.
 For the most part they are generally played in a slow and open fashion, so their
 great for beginners to build coordination on the drum kit.  Although they shouldn't
 be overlooked by experience players either, since they are one of the more important
 foundational skills all drummers should be familiar with.   

  These lessons start out with a common theme, in order to keep it simple, we'll
 either keep the Hi hat / bass drum parts or the Hihat / Snare parts the same
 through each exercise. This lets us work on either our Snare hand or Bass Drum
 playing separately.  To finish off, we'll make some combined examples.

  This are only a brief look at the potential of this kind of study, to take this
 further you are encouraged to make up your own combined examples, change the drum
 voicing, add dynamics, go crazy !. 

  Well .. Have fun!




 ==============
 Practice Aims:
 ==============


 Aim #1: Try to get comfortable playing each rhythm through once, with & without the
         counting. If you can do this, try playing it twice, three, four times through
         or more without stopping. 


 Aim #2: Try for a range of tempos, Start out slowly, (around 80/90 bpm's) then medium
         (120bpm) and fast up to (150/160 bpm's or higher). The objective is make all
         the notes sound even. 


 Aim #3: Try playing each line of exercises without stopping, keeping it evenly spaced
         the entire time. Next, Try 2 lines, then 3 lines and ultimately the entire
         lesson from top to bottom. To take this another step further, you can try
         playing the exercises randomly, this will help your reading and visualization
         skills greatly.
