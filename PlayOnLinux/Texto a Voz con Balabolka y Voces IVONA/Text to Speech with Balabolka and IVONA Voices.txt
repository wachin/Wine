This is a tutorial on how to install Ivona voices on Linux



INSTRUCTIONS:

Put the following in a terminal:

sudo apt-get install playonlinux leafpad

Note: This command is for Ubuntu and Debian derivatives.

Install in WineOnLinux the version of Wine 2.17 which is the last one in which SAPI 5 can be operated. In PlayOnLinux click on:

Tools / Manage versions of Wine

2.17

If you have a 32-bit operating system, only one tab will appear that says:

"Wine Versions (x86)"

but if you had a 64-bit operating system you will see two tabs, on the right side one that says: "Wine Versions (x64)" If that is the case, always do this installation in the 32-bit tab, because the version of IVONA that we are going to install is only for 32 bits, but do not worry that will be responsible for emulating your operating system if it was 64 bits for Windows executables within Wine.
